<p> You have finished the study.</p>

{{if sum_correct < 3}} <p> Unfortunately, you answered more than one of the comprehension questions incorrectly.
    Therefore, you will not receive a bonus payment. </p>
    {{else}}
    <p> <b> You will receive a bonus payment.</b> </p>


    <p> The randomly drawn round was round {{drawn_round | to0}} from part {{drawn_block | to0}} of the game.</p>

    <p> In this round, you chose option {{relevant_round_choice}}.</p>

    <p> With this option, your monetary bonus was {{outcome_bonus_points}} study dollar. This will be converted to
        {{outcome_bonus_pound}}Â£ and paid to you as a bonus.
    </p>
    <p> With this option, your carbon emissions were {{outcome_carbon}}lbs CO2. The carbon emissions will be realized
        through carbon emission certificates.

    <p> Below, you can find more information on the background of the study.</p>

    <p>
        In this study we examine how people make trade-offs between own monetary payoffs and carbon emissions. Moreover,
        we examine how the implementation of risk (i.e., outcomes are based on different probabilities) can affect these
        trade-off choices.
    </p>

    <p>Recall that we will buy carbon emission certificates in accordance with your choice that was selected for real
        consequences. Thus, your decision affects the amount of CO2 certificates we will buy and thus the extent to
        which CO2 certificates will be taken from the market. With less certificates on the market, less carbon can be
        emitted in total. </p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the study, in particular if you feel uncomfortable with the decisions
        you made, please contact the main researcher, Dr. Sebastian Olschewski, Sebastian.olschewski@unibas.ch.</p>
