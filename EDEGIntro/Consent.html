    <p>
        You have been invited to take part in a research study to read and rate different statements. This study will be
        supervised by Prof. Ulf J.J. Hahnel, Faculty of Psychology, University of Basel, Switzerland and Zahra Rahmani
        Azad, Faculty of Psychology, University of Basel.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Complete a set of online questionnaires. You may be asked to rate how well certain statements or personality
            traits describe you.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will also be asked to report some demographic information, including your age, gender, political partisanship, and income.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will make several decisions between two options with different monetary outcomes. <b>Your bonus payoff for this study depends on the choices you will make in each trial, and may vary.  </b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Duration: </strong>  
        Participation in this study will require approximately <b>10 to 15 minutes</b> of your time. </p>

    <p> <strong> Risks and Benefits: </strong>
        There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. You
        will be incentivized by Prolific for taking part in this study. Your participation
        may help to better understand open research questions in behavioral and environmental psychology.

        
        Your reimbursement will involve a <b>fixed payment of £1.50 (which equals to around USD $1.87). 
        </b>On top of that, depending on your choices during the study, you <b>may or may not get an additional
            bonus payment of up to £1.10 (which equals to around USD $1.37)</b>.
    </p>
    <p> Final Payoff = Fixed Amount + Bonus</p>

    <p> <strong>Data Protection: </strong> 
        Confidentiality of your data records will be strictly maintained by assigning code numbers to each participant
        so that data is never directly linked to individual identity. No one, including the researchers of this study,
        will be able to reveal your identity. The data will be made available in an anonymized form on Open Science
        platforms allowing other researchers to use the data for their research purposes. All sensitive information that
        might potentially be used to reveal your identity will be removed from the dataset prior to publishing the data.
        We, the researchers on the project, will also never know the identity of any of the participants, unless you
        will reveal it to us by contacting us via mail. 
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without
            penalty. </strong> You will only receive a payment for participation if you complete the study all 
            the way to the end.  </p>


    <p>
        If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear to you, if you have questions or wish
        to report a research-related problem, please use the message tool in Prolific or write an email to zahra.rahmani@unibas.ch.
