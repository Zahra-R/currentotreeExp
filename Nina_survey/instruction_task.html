        In the following we will ask you to judge the carbon intensity of different carbon foorprints. <br>
        This means giving your best educated guess about <b>how much carbon emissions (CO2) you think the presented carbon footprint produces </b>.  <br>
        You will be asked to make this judgment on a <b>scale from 1 to 10</b>, so you do not have to estimate any numbers. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A personal carbon footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases (including CO2 and methane) that are emitted into the atmosphere as a result of an individual's consumption, <br>
        their private investments, and their share of public services. <br>
        The carbon footprint thus includes emissions from driving, flying, using electricity, cooling or heating your home, purchasing goods and services, and public services (e.g., road construction, schools, and military).<br>
         In other words, a personal carbon footprint reflects an individual's total impact on the climate system. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        On average a persons carbon footprint in the UK is about <b>11.7 tons per year</b>.<br>
        To reach <b>global climate change mitigation goals</b>, each individual would need to only emit about <b>>2 â€“ 2.8 tons</b> of CO2 per year.<br>
        The carbon footprints you will see are reduced to 6 behaviors, so they do not equal a full carbon footprint of consumption a person actually produces.<br>

        In our task a very high carbon footprint based on the 6 behaviors would equal about 8 tons of CO2 and a small carbon footprint about 5 ton of CO2. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next you will see how the task will look like.<br>
        Then you will make <b> 16</b> of these ratings. <br>
        Each time evaluating how <b> climate friendly each individual's carbon fooprint</b> seems to you.  <br>
        You will make these ratings on a scale from </i>1 (very little)</i> to  <i> 10 (very much)</i>. <br>
