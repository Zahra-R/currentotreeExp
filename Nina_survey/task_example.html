<p>
    This is how a carbon footprint of an individual looks like in our task. <br>

    <br>
    <br>
</p>

The different lifestyles these individuals have refer to:

    <li> Traveling on vacation: The respective person either <b>flies twice a year</b> or <b>never flies to go on vacation </b> </li>
    <li> Commuting to workj: A person either commutes a total of 20km to and from work everyday, 5 days a week for 48 weeks per year <b>by bike</b>  or <b>by bus</b> </li>
    <li> Recycling behavior: Individuals either <b>recycle comprehensively</b> or <b>do not recycle</b> </li>

    <li> Dieraty behavior: A person can either follow a <b>meat-based diet</b> (omnivorous) or a <b>plant-based</b> diet (vegetarian)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Next, you will estimate the carbon footprint of <b>16</b> persons with different lifestlyes. <br>
    Please look at each individual carbon footprint carefully and take some time to come up with an evaluation. <br>
