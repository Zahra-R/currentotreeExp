<p>
    This is how a carbon footprint of an individual looks like in our task. <br>
    <img  style="width:55%; "  src=/static/global/images/example.png>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

The different lifestyles these individuals have refer to:
<ul> 
    <li> Regionality of food purchases: The respective person either buys and consumes <b>mainly regional food </b> or <b>also imported</b> food items </li>
    <li> Traveling on vacation: The respective person either <b>takes two medium distance flights a year (=3-6hours)</b> or <b>never flies to go on vacation </b> </li>

</ul>

<p>
    Next, you will estimate the carbon footprint of <b>16</b> persons with different lifestlyes. <br>
    Please look at each individual carbon footprint carefully and take some time to come up with an evaluation. <br>
