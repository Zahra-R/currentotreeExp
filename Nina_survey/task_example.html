<p>
    This is how a carbon footprint of an individual looks like in our task. <br>
    <img  style="width:45%; height: 55%; "  src=/static/global/images/example.png>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

The different lifestyles these individuals have refer to:
<ul> 
    <li> <b>Dieraty behavior:</b> The respective person either followa a <b>meat-based diet (omnivorous)</b> or a <b>plant-based diet (vegetarian)</b> </li>
    <li> <b>Recycling behavior:</b> The respective person either <b>recycle comprehensively</b> or <b>does not recycle</b> </li>
    <li> <b>Regionality of food purchases:</b> The respective person either buys and consumes <b>mainly regional food </b> or <b>also imported</b> food items </li>
    <li> <b>Electricity supply:</b> The respective person either subscribed to an electricity supply that is <b>conventional, fossil based but includes some renewable source</b> or <b>based 100% on renewable energy sources</b> </li>
    <li> <b>Commuting to work:</b> The respective person either commutes a total of 20km to and from work everyday, 5 days a week for 48 weeks per year <b>by bike</b>  or <b>by bus</b> </li>
    <li> <b>Traveling on vacation:</b> The respective person either <b>takes two medium distance flights a year (=3-6hours)</b> or <b>never flies to go on vacation </b> </li>

</ul>

<p>
    Next, you will estimate the carbon footprint of <b>16</b> persons with different lifestlyes. <br>
    Please look at each individual carbon footprint carefully and take some time to come up with an evaluation. <br>
    The order of presentation of the behaviors will change across the 16 examples you will see.
