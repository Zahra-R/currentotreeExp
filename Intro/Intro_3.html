<h3> Instructions <span id="part_no"></span> </h3>
<h5>Please read the instructions carefully! </h5>

    <p> <strong>In each round, you can gain or lose points.
        </strong> 
    </p>
    <p> <b> At the end of the study, one round will be randomly drawn.</b> The outcome from this round  will decide your bonus payment<span class="Exp_Con"> and the environmental outcome</span>. <span class="Exp_Con">The carbon emissions from that
        round will be realized.</span> The points you gained or lost in that round will be converted into British Pounds
        (conversion rate: 200 points &#8793; £1) and will be added to your initial bonus payment of £1. Note that your bonus
        payment is never negative. The minimum bonus payment you can get is £0. </p>
</div>

<div>            
    <p>
        <b>Example:</b> Imagine you played 2 rounds. In round 1, you lost 100 points<span class="Exp_Con"> and the carbon emissions were 10 pounds</span>.
        In round 2, you gained 50 points<span class="Exp_Con"> and carbon emissions were zero</span>.
        At the end, the computer will draw randomly either round 1 or round 2. If round 1 is drawn, your payoff will be
        -100 points, divided by 200 = -£0.5. Your bonus payment will then be £1 (initial endowment) -£0.5 = £0.5 (equal to around USD $0.62). <span class="Exp_Con">The carbon emissions of 10 lbs will be realized by selling a CO2 certificate
        that allows the buyer to emit 10 lbs of CO2.</span> 
    </p>
